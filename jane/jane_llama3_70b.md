The Independent Jane
  For all the love, romance and scandal in Jane Austen’s books, what they are really about is freedom and independence. Independence of thought and the freedom to choose.
  Elizabeth’s refusal of Mr. Collins offer of marriage showed an independence seldom seen in heroines of the day. Her refusal of Mr. Darcy while triggered by anger showed a level of independence that left him shocked and stunned.
  The freedom she exhibited in finally accepting him in direct defiance of Lady Catherine and knowing her father would disapprove was unusual even for Austen. In her last book Anne Elliot is persuaded to refuse Captain Wentworth at Lady Russel’s insistence.
  Although Jane played by the rules of the day, all of her writing is infused with how she wanted life to be. She ‘screams’ her outrage at the limitations for women in Emma.
  When accosted by Mrs. Elton, Jane Fairfax says,
  “Excuse me, ma’am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce something — offices for the sale, not quite of human flesh, but of human intellect.”
  “Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition.”
  “I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,” replied Jane; “governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely different certainly, as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies.”
  That same sentiment is emphasized in Emma’s shock when Mrs. Weston tells her of Frank Churchill’s secret engagement to Jane.
  “Good God!” cried Emma, “Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself — to suffer her even to think of such a measure!”
  I find it interesting that at the moment of Austen’s birth or there about, John Adams left his farm in Massachusetts for the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Doesn’t sound particularly interesting, I know but consider this.
  John Adams left his home in mid-December 1775 to attend an unprecedented meeting of colonial representatives to consider severing ties with their mother country and her monarch; a decision that culminated in a document unlike any ever written. In the mother country, one day in that same cold December a baby girl was born at Steventon Rectory. Her cry was heard by only the people in the house but the years to come would see her pen create works unlike any the world had ever seen.
  Comparing Austen’s words with Thomas Jefferson’s may seem a trivialization but I believe that Austen’s impact on the world is no less important than Jefferson’s. The effect of Jane’s writing maybe more subtle than that of the Virginian but it is no less influential.
  Jefferson’s words instigated and promoted a revolution, a war of independence. Jane’s words had no such excessive consequence. Still in her own quiet, genteel yet powerful way she declared and promoted the same principles of freedom and self-regulated independence as our American forefathers. In all her novels Jane advocates independence of person and thought, the rights of all and acceptance of responsibility for those rights.
  Jane may not have incited military action as Jefferson did but even as an avowed royalist, I doubt not that Jane Austen firmly believed in his declaration of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Hmm, this is really interesting. I'm trying to wrap my head around the idea that Jane Austen's writing, despite being seemingly conservative in its setting and characters, is actually about the pursuit of freedom and independence... I mean, when you think about it, those are pretty radical ideas for the time period.

What if we look at her heroines, like Elizabeth and Anne, and how they navigate these societal expectations and norms to forge their own paths? It's not just about individual freedom, but also about the rights of women, which was a pretty revolutionary concept at the time.

And then there's that great quote from Emma, where Jane Fairfax is basically highlighting the horrors of the governess trade, which is this fascinating metaphor for the limitations placed on women. I mean, the way she frames it as not quite but similar to the slave-trade is just... wow. 

That parallel to Thomas Jefferson's writing is really thought-provoking. I never thought of Austen's work as a kind of subtle, literary equivalent of the Declaration of Independence. It's as if Austen is taking those same principles of freedom and self-regulation and applying them to the personal lives of her characters.

Oh, and the timing of Austen's birth, coinciding with John Adams' departure for the Continental Congress... I'm seeing connections here between the American Revolution and Austen's own writing. It's almost as if the spirit of that time period, with its focus on independence and self-determination, is infused in Austen's work.

I wonder if that's why Austen's writing has lasted so long, despite being set in a very specific time and place. There's something timeless about the themes of personal freedom and independence that speaks to readers across cultures and time periods.

Hmm... I'm starting to see Austen's work in a whole new light now. What if her writing isn't just about romance and social commentary, but about inspiring readers to take control of their own lives and make their own choices?

This idea that Austen's writing is, in its own way, a call to independence and self-determination... I'm not sure if I buy it entirely, but it's definitely got me thinking. 

Let me play devil's advocate for a second. What if Austen's work is actually more complex, more multifaceted than that? What if, instead of being all about independence and freedom, it's actually about navigating the complexities of social relationships and finding one's place within a larger community?

I mean, take Emma, for example. She's this confident, independent woman who thinks she knows what's best for everyone around her. But as the novel progresses, we see her struggling with her own biases and limitations, and ultimately learning to humble herself and listen to others.

Or take Anne Elliot in Persuasion. She's this epitome of self-control and restraint, but beneath that reserve, she's still struggling with her own emotions and desires. Her independence isn't about being some kind of superhero, but about finding the courage to be herself and follow her own heart.

Hmm... I think I'm getting stuck on this idea that Austen's work is somehow more straightforward than it actually is. But what if the beauty of her writing lies in its subtlety, its nuance? What if it's not just about grand declarations of independence, but about the small, everyday choices we make to assert our own autonomy and individuality?

Oh, and I just thought of something else. What if Austen's own life, her own experiences as a woman writer in the early 19th century, influenced her writing in ways we can't even begin to imagine? I mean, she's often portrayed as this brilliant, insightful writer, but what if she was also just trying to make a living, to navigate the challenges of her own time and place?

I need to circle back to that quote from Emma, the one about the governess trade. There's something about the way Fairfax frames her own independence as a kind of privilege, a luxury she can afford because of her education and social status. What does that say about the ways in which independence is tied to privilege, to access to resources and opportunities?

Ugh, I feel like I'm all over the place now. But that's kind of exciting, right? The more I think about Austen's work, the more I realize how complex, how multifaceted it is. It's like there are layers and layers of meaning just waiting to be uncovered...

I'm having trouble untangling this idea of independence and privilege in Austen's work. It's like, on the one hand, she's celebrating the idea of women making their own choices and forging their own paths. But on the other hand, she's also acknowledging the ways in which those choices are constrained by social class, economic status, and access to education.

What if Austen is actually highlighting the ways in which independence is not just a personal choice, but also a collective responsibility? I mean, think about it - in her novels, the characters who are most independent, most self-assured, are also the ones who are most embedded in their communities. They're not just individual superheroes, but rather, they're part of a larger web of relationships and social connections.

Hmm... I'm starting to see a connection between Austen's work and the idea of "interdependence." You know, the idea that our individual freedoms are actually inextricably linked to the freedoms of those around us. What if Austen is showing us that true independence is not about being solitary or self-sufficient, but rather about being connected, being part of a larger whole?

I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it's something I want to explore further. Maybe Austen's work is not just about celebrating individual freedom, but also about highlighting the ways in which our choices, our actions, impact those around us.

Oh, and that reminds me of something else. What if Austen's novels are actually a kind of critique of the idea of "rugged individualism"? You know, that whole narrative about the self-made person, who achieves success through hard work and determination alone. What if Austen is actually showing us that that narrative is a myth, that we're all interdependent, and that our successes are always tied to the successes of those around us?

I need to think more about this, but I feel like I'm onto something. There's this fascinating tension in Austen's work between individual freedom and collective responsibility, between the desire for independence and the recognition of our interdependence.

Let me play with that idea for a bit. What if Austen's novels are actually a kind of exploration of the ways in which we balance our individual desires with our collective responsibilities? What if she's showing us that true independence is not about being free from others, but rather about being free with others, in the sense that we're able to connect, to relate, to care for one another?

Hmm... I think I might be getting somewhere with this.

I'm still trying to untangle this idea of individual freedom versus collective responsibility in Austen's work. What if her novels are actually a kind of nuanced exploration of the ways in which these two concepts intersect and intersecting?

I'm thinking about Emma, for example. On the one hand, Emma is this confident, independent woman who thinks she knows what's best for everyone around her. But on the other hand, she's also deeply embedded in her community, and her actions have a profound impact on those around her.

What if Emma's journey is not just about learning to temper her individual desires with a sense of collective responsibility, but also about recognizing the ways in which her own freedom is tied to the freedoms of those around her? I mean, think about it - Emma's independence is not just about making her own choices, but also about creating space for others to make their own choices, to live their own lives.

And then there's the character of Mr. Knightley, who is often seen as this voice of reason and moral authority in the novel. But what if Mr. Knightley is actually not just a solo figure of authority, but rather a symbol of the collective values and norms of the community?

I'm starting to see a pattern here. What if Austen's novels are actually structured around these kinds of collective values and norms, rather than individual protagonists? What if the true hero of her novels is not just the individual protagonist, but rather the community as a whole?

Oh, and that makes me think of something else. What if Austen's use of satire and social commentary is actually a way of critiquing the excesses of individualism, of highlighting the ways in which our individual desires can sometimes conflict with the greater good?

I'm not sure if that's a stretch, but it's definitely an idea I want to explore further. Maybe Austen's novels are not just about celebrating individual freedom, but also about highlighting the importance of collective responsibility, of recognizing that our individual choices have consequences for those around us.

Let me think about this some more. What if Austen's novels are actually a kind of exploration of the tension between individual freedom and collective responsibility, between the desire for independence and the recognition of our interdependence? What if she's showing us that true independence is not just about making our own choices, but also about recognizing the ways in which our choices impact those around us?

Hmm... I think I'm getting somewhere with this.

I'm starting to see a connection between Austen's exploration of individual freedom and collective responsibility, and her use of settings and social context. What if the settings of her novels, whether it's the English countryside or the social circles of Bath, are actually a way of highlighting the collective values and norms that shape individual choices?

I think about it - in Austen's time, social context was everything. Your family, your social class, your occupation - all of these things defined who you were and what options were available to you. And Austen's novels reflect that, don't they?

Take Pride and Prejudice, for example. The novel is set against the backdrop of the English gentry, with all its rules and social expectations. And Elizabeth Bennet's journey is not just about falling in love with Mr. Darcy, but also about navigating that social context, about finding her place within it.

What if Austen is using those settings to highlight the ways in which our individual choices are always shaped by our collective context? What if she's showing us that our freedom to make choices is not just a personal freedom, but also a collective one, shaped by the social norms and values that surround us?

I'm also thinking about the way Austen uses her characters to explore different social classes and occupations. What if her portrayal of characters from different walks of life is actually a way of highlighting the ways in which individual freedom is tied to social class and economic status?

Take the character of Fanny Price in Mansfield Park, for example. Fanny is a poor young woman from a lower social class, and her entire life is shaped by her economic circumstances. And yet, Austen portrays Fanny as this strong, independent individual who makes her own choices and forges her own path.

What if Austen is using Fanny's character to highlight the ways in which individual freedom is tied to economic status, to access to resources and opportunities? What if she's showing us that true freedom is not just about making our own choices, but also about having the economic means to follow those choices through?

Hmm... I think I'm getting somewhere with this. Maybe Austen's novels are not just about celebrating individual freedom, but also about highlighting the ways in which that freedom is shaped by our collective context, by our social class, our occupation, and our economic status.

Oh, and that makes me think of something else. What if Austen's novels are actually a kind of critique of the idea of meritocracy, of the notion that we are all equally free to make our own choices and succeed based on our individual merits?

I'm not sure if that's a stretch, but it's definitely an idea I want to explore further. Maybe Austen's novels are not just about celebrating individual freedom, but also about highlighting the ways in which that freedom is shaped by systemic inequalities and social biases.

I'm starting to see a connection between Austen's critique of meritocracy and her use of satire and social commentary. What if her novels are actually a way of poking fun at the idea that we are all equally free to make our own choices and succeed based on our individual merits?

I think about it - Austen's novels are full of characters who are trapped by their own circumstances, who are limited by their social class, their family, or their occupation. And yet, Austen never portrays these characters as simply victims of circumstance. Instead, she shows us how they navigate their situations, how they make the best of what they have, and how they sometimes even subvert the expectations placed upon them.

What if Austen is using satire and social commentary to highlight the ways in which the notion of meritocracy can be a myth? What if she's showing us that our individual successes and failures are not always a result of our own merits, but also of the societal context in which we live?

Take the character of Mr. Wickham in Pride and Prejudice, for example. Wickham is this charming, affable young man who presents himself as a victim of circumstance, who claims that he's been treated unfairly by Mr. Darcy. But as the novel progresses, we learn that Wickham is actually a scoundrel, who has manipulated and taken advantage of others to get what he wants.

What if Austen is using Wickham's character to satirize the idea of meritocracy, to show us how people can use false narratives about their own merits to gain advantage over others? What if she's highlighting the ways in which societal expectations and biases can actually limit our individual freedoms, rather than increasing them?

I'm also thinking about the way Austen portrays social class in her novels. What if her depiction of the differences between the upper and lower classes is actually a commentary on the limitations of social mobility, on the ways in which our individual opportunities and choices are shaped by our social context?

Take the character of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, for example. Lady Catherine is this proud, aristocratic woman who believes that she is superior to others based on her social status. But Austen portrays Lady Catherine as this absurd, comical figure, who is actually trapped by her own social position, who is limited by her own lack of understanding and empathy.

What if Austen is using Lady Catherine's character to satirize the idea of social superiority, to show us how societal expectations and biases can actually limit our individual freedoms and opportunities? What if she's highlighting the ways in which our individual choices and successes are not always a result of our own merits, but also of the societal context in which we live?

Hmm... I think I'm getting somewhere with this. Maybe Austen's novels are not just about celebrating individual freedom, but also about highlighting the ways in which that freedom is limited by societal expectations and biases.
