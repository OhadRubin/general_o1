The Independent Jane
For all the love, romance and scandal in Jane Austen’s books, what they are really about is freedom and independence. Independence of thought and the freedom to choose.
Elizabeth’s refusal of Mr. Collins offer of marriage showed an independence seldom seen in heroines of the day. Her refusal of Mr. Darcy while triggered by anger showed a level of independence that left him shocked and stunned.
The freedom she exhibited in finally accepting him in direct defiance of Lady Catherine and knowing her father would disapprove was unusual even for Austen. In her last book Anne Elliot is persuaded to refuse Captain Wentworth at Lady Russel’s insistence.
Although Jane played by the rules of the day, all of her writing is infused with how she wanted life to be. She ‘screams’ her outrage at the limitations for women in Emma.
When accosted by Mrs. Elton, Jane Fairfax says,
“Excuse me, ma’am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce something — offices for the sale, not quite of human flesh, but of human intellect.”
“Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition.”
“I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,” replied Jane; “governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely different certainly, as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies.”
That same sentiment is emphasized in Emma’s shock when Mrs. Weston tells her of Frank Churchill’s secret engagement to Jane.
“Good God!” cried Emma, “Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself — to suffer her even to think of such a measure!”
I find it interesting that at the moment of Austen’s birth or there about, John Adams left his farm in Massachusetts for the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Doesn’t sound particularly interesting, I know but consider this.
John Adams left his home in mid-December 1775 to attend an unprecedented meeting of colonial representatives to consider severing ties with their mother country and her monarch; a decision that culminated in a document unlike any ever written. In the mother country, one day in that same cold December a baby girl was born at Steventon Rectory. Her cry was heard by only the people in the house but the years to come would see her pen create works unlike any the world had ever seen.
Comparing Austen’s words with Thomas Jefferson’s may seem a trivialization but I believe that Austen’s impact on the world is no less important than Jefferson’s. The effect of Jane’s writing maybe more subtle than that of the Virginian but it is no less influential.
Jefferson’s words instigated and promoted a revolution, a war of independence. Jane’s words had no such excessive consequence. Still in her own quiet, genteel yet powerful way she declared and promoted the same principles of freedom and self-regulated independence as our American forefathers. In all her novels Jane advocates independence of person and thought, the rights of all and acceptance of responsibility for those rights.
Jane may not have incited military action as Jefferson did but even as an avowed royalist, I doubt not that Jane Austen firmly believed in his declaration of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Hmm, this is really fascinating. So, let me see if I can unpack some of this. The idea that Jane Austen, nestled in her quiet world of 18th-century England, was advocating for independence and freedom in her novels is so compelling. I mean, I’m wondering if we often overlook the subtleties in her writing because we tend to think of her works as just romance or social commentary. It’s almost like there’s a deeper layer—like an undercurrent of revolution, but not in the way we traditionally think of it. 
  
  Building on that, Elizabeth Bennet’s refusal of Mr. Collins is such a pivotal moment, right? It’s not just a personal choice; it’s this bold statement against societal expectations. I keep circling back to the notion that in a time when women had so few rights, her independence was quite radical. Wait a minute, what does that say about Austen’s own views? I can’t help but think that perhaps she was subtly pushing back against the confines of her own society.
  
  Now, I’m also struck by this parallel drawn between Jane Austen and John Adams. It’s intriguing to think about the timing of their lives. Here’s a woman who’s creating a literary revolution, and simultaneously, there’s this political upheaval happening across the ocean. The contrast is almost poetic, isn’t it? I mean, Adams was advocating for freedom from tyranny, while Austen was illustrating the tyranny of societal norms placed on women. I wonder how she viewed these developments in her own context. Was she influenced by the political changes, or was she more focused on her immediate social world?
  
  Oh! That reminds me of the quote from Jane Fairfax. The way she speaks about the “governess-trade” really highlights the limited options available to women of her time. I’m starting to see a pattern here—Austen’s characters often grapple with their roles in society and express a desire for more autonomy. The trick here is that, while her characters navigate these societal constraints, Austen herself plays within those same boundaries to convey her messages. It’s almost like a chess game, where the pieces move carefully within defined rules, yet the strategy can still create profound change.
  
  Now we’re cooking! I feel like there’s something here about the intersection of personal choice and societal expectations. Emma’s horror at Jane Fairfax's engagement to Frank Churchill reflects a deeper concern about social status and the implications of stepping outside one’s assigned role. It’s almost like a commentary on how women’s worth was often tied to their marital prospects rather than their personal agency.
  
  I'm grappling with the idea that Austen's work, while seemingly genteel, carries a weight of social critique. It’s rough, but maybe her “quiet” revolution was about planting seeds of thought in her readers’ minds. And that’s where her influence might parallel Jefferson’s. While he called for overt change, Austen seemed to suggest that even small acts of defiance and the assertion of one’s rights were equally significant.
  
  Coming at this from another angle, I can’t help but think about how the impact of literature can be profound in shaping societal norms and attitudes. Austen’s advocacy for women’s independence, whether in the context of marriage or employment, feels incredibly relevant today. So, what keeps nagging at me is how her ideas resonate even in contemporary discussions about gender roles. 
  
  Let me throw this out there: could it be that Austen's subtlety is what makes her work timeless? Not sure if this fits, but perhaps the enduring nature of her themes is a testament to the ongoing struggle for independence and equality. I feel like this conversation could go in so many directions, and there’s probably more to it than I can articulate right now. 
  
  Alright, I need to circle back to the idea of societal limitations. I’m still feeling my way through how Austen’s own life experiences might have shaped her views. Why did she choose to depict these particular struggles? There’s probably a whole aspect of her personal history that could illuminate this, and I’m not quite there yet in piecing it all together. 
  
  It's a bit murky, but I think I’m starting to see how Austen's works serve as a mirror reflecting her world while also pushing against it. The relationship between her characters' choices and their societal roles feels crucial. What about the impact of her royalist stance amidst her advocacy for personal freedoms? That’s another layer to untangle. I guess I’m still wrestling with the idea that her nuanced approach to independence truly revolutionized how we think about women's roles, even if it didn’t incite a physical uprising like Jefferson’s words did. 
  
  This isn't quite right yet, but I can feel the connections forming. I wonder how we can further explore the implications of her ideas about self-regulated independence in today’s context. Wouldn't it be interesting to see how modern readers resonate with her themes? The dialogue around freedom and choice feels like it could keep evolving, much like her own characters did in their respective narratives.
  
  Okay, let’s keep diving into this, because I feel there’s so much more to unravel. I keep coming back to how Austen’s characters often find themselves at a crossroads, where personal desires clash with societal expectations. It’s almost like they’re navigating a maze, and every choice they make is laden with consequences, both for themselves and for those around them. 
  
  Now, if we think about Elizabeth Bennet again, her journey isn’t just about love; it’s about asserting her identity. I mean, here’s a character who, despite the pressure to conform, chooses to follow her own heart, which is quite a radical act of independence. Let me work through this: when she rejects Mr. Collins, she’s not simply turning down a marriage proposal; she’s making a statement about her self-worth. It’s a bold declaration that resonates with the idea of autonomy. 
  
  I'm getting a sense that this theme of independence isn’t limited to romantic choices, either. It extends into the professional realm with characters like Jane Fairfax. The way she articulates her disdain for the “governess-trade” feels like a critique of the limited roles available to women, almost as if Austen is using her voice to advocate for something more substantial. It’s like she’s shining a light on the plight of women who were forced into subservient positions and encouraging a dialogue about their rights. 
  
  Oh! That reminds me of the contrast between Jane Fairfax and Emma Woodhouse. Emma, with her wealth and status, embodies a type of independence that’s rooted in privilege, while Jane represents the struggle for recognition in a world that often disregards women’s contributions. I can see how this highlights the different facets of independence—one that is granted by social status and one that must be fought for. 
  
  Now, I’m wondering about how this all ties back to the broader societal changes occurring during Austen’s lifetime. The late 18th and early 19th centuries were rife with discussions about rights, both political and personal. Could it be that Austen was subtly engaging with these conversations through her characters? There’s something about the timing that feels significant; she was witnessing the ripples of revolution, even if they weren’t directly related to her world. 
  
  Backing up for a second, I think it’s important to consider how Austen herself navigated her role as a woman writer in a male-dominated literary landscape. What I’m grappling with is how she balanced her royalist views with her advocacy for personal freedom. It’s almost contradictory, but perhaps that tension is what makes her work so rich and complex. 
  
  Let’s also not forget the implications of her choice to remain unmarried. This is just a first pass, but I wonder if her own life choices reflect a deeper understanding of independence. It’s like she was saying that fulfillment doesn’t always come from marriage, and that’s a powerful message in a society that often equated a woman’s value with her marital status. 
  
  I’m still fuzzy on the relationship between her personal beliefs and her characters’ journeys. How did her experiences shape the worlds she created? It feels like there’s a gap in understanding how her own life influenced her portrayals of independence. I need more time with this idea—digging into her biography might shed some light on her motivations.
  
  This connects to the notion of legacy, too. What keeps nagging at me is how Austen’s subtle advocacy for independence could have influenced generations of women writers and readers. I mean, her characters may have faced societal limitations, but their stories provide a lens through which we can examine our own struggles for autonomy. 
  
  Picture this: a contemporary reader picking up "Pride and Prejudice" and recognizing Elizabeth’s defiance as a reflection of their own quest for self-determination. Isn’t that incredible? The way Austen’s themes transcend time and continue to resonate speaks to the universality of her message. 
  
  This is starting to take shape, and it’s fascinating to think about how we might explore these ideas further. I wonder if there’s a way to draw parallels between Austen’s advocacy for women’s independence and modern movements for gender equality. There’s probably a whole conversation waiting to happen about how literature can inspire social change, and Austen’s voice feels like a cornerstone in that discourse. 
  
  But I guess what I’m trying to articulate is that while Austen may not have wielded a quill to incite rebellion, her writing certainly challenged the status quo. There’s something profound in the way she advocated for personal freedom through the lens of everyday life. It’s almost as if she was laying the groundwork for a quiet revolution—a revolution of thought that continues to inspire and provoke discussion today. 
  
  I feel like I’m still forming this thought, and there’s so much more to explore here. What about the nuances of her satire? How does that play into our understanding of her views on independence? I need to consider how her wit and humor contribute to her critique of society, and whether it serves to empower her characters further. 
  
  I guess I’m still trying to reconcile how all these elements fit together. The connection between personal independence and societal critique feels crucial, but I’m not quite there yet in fully articulating it. There’s definitely more to unpack about how Austen’s legacy speaks to contemporary issues of self-actualization and autonomy. 
  
  Alright, let’s keep digging into this, because I feel like we’re really scratching the surface of something substantial here. I keep thinking about how Austen’s use of wit and satire not only provides humor but also functions as a critical lens through which to view societal norms. The thing is, her sharp observations about class, marriage, and gender roles offer not just entertainment but a kind of subtle rebellion against the constraints of her time.
  
  Now, I’m wondering, how does Austen’s humor play into her critique? I mean, when characters like Mr. Collins are portrayed in such an exaggerated light, it almost feels like Austen is using them as cautionary tales. It’s almost like—wait a minute—she’s inviting the reader to laugh at these absurdities, while simultaneously critiquing the very systems that allow such characters to thrive. This might sound weird, but it’s like she’s saying, “Look at how ridiculous this is; do we really want to live like this?”
  
  This connects to the idea of empowerment, too. When Elizabeth Bennet stands up to Mr. Collins, it’s not just a personal triumph; it’s a moment that resonates with the reader as a stand against societal absurdity. I can see how Austen’s humor might empower her readers to question their own societal roles. The more I think about it, the more I see that her novels serve as a mirror, reflecting the expectations placed upon women and providing a space for readers to reconsider their own situations.
  
  Let me work through this: perhaps Austen’s satire is a form of advocacy in itself. By highlighting the absurdities of her society, she encourages her readers—especially women—to think critically about their own lives and the choices available to them. There’s something here about how literature can serve as a catalyst for change, even if it’s subtle. 
  
  I’m starting to see a pattern emerge: Austen’s characters often embody a struggle for self-definition within the confines of societal expectations. It’s like each character’s journey is a reflection of the broader challenges women faced during her time. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but there’s a profound connection between personal autonomy and societal critique that feels essential to understanding her work.
  
  Now, let’s think about the implications of her positioning as a royalist. I mean, could it be that her royalist leanings influenced her portrayal of independence? It’s a bit murky, but I wonder if she believed in a certain hierarchy while simultaneously advocating for individual rights. This contradiction might reflect the complexities of her own understanding of freedom within a structured society. 
  
  What about her own life experiences? I need to circle back to that—how did her family dynamics and societal position shape her views? There’s probably a rich tapestry of influences at play here, and I’m still feeling my way through how her background might have impacted her writing. 
  
  Just spitballing here, but I think it could be valuable to explore how Austen’s upbringing in a relatively stable family environment allowed her the freedom to observe and critique societal norms. It’s almost like she had the privilege of perspective, which enabled her to write with such insight into the struggles of women in her time. 
  
  And then there’s the question of legacy. What keeps nagging at me is how Austen’s nuanced exploration of independence paved the way for future generations of women writers. I can see how her work might have inspired others to explore themes of autonomy and self-expression. It’s fascinating to think about how her voice has echoed through time and continues to resonate with readers today. 
  
  I’m still grappling with the idea that while Austen might not have consciously set out to incite a revolution, her literary contributions have undeniably contributed to the ongoing dialogue about women’s rights and independence. It feels like there’s a thread connecting her work to contemporary movements for gender equality, and I’d love to explore that further. 
  
  I guess I’m still forming this thought, but it’s exciting to consider how literature can serve as a vehicle for social change. Austen’s characters, with their struggles for independence, reflect a broader narrative about the fight for personal freedom that is still relevant today. 
  
  I need to circle back to the nuances of her satire and how they might play into our understanding of her views on independence. It’s almost like she’s holding up a mirror to society, urging her readers to question and reflect on their own lives. This isn’t quite right yet, but I feel like I’m on the brink of uncovering something significant about how Austen’s quiet yet powerful advocacy for independence continues to inspire and challenge us. 
  
  So, what about the connection between her themes and modern discussions around autonomy? It could be worthwhile to explore how contemporary readers engage with her work and how her ideas about independence resonate in today’s cultural landscape. There’s definitely a conversation waiting to be had there, and I’m eager to dig deeper into that intersection of past and present.
  
  Alright, let’s keep peeling back the layers here, because there’s just so much to consider. So, as I think about the connection between Austen’s themes of independence and modern discussions around autonomy, I can’t help but wonder how her narratives can inform contemporary feminist perspectives. It’s almost like she’s providing a blueprint for understanding the complexities of womanhood and the ongoing struggle for equality.
  
  I keep circling back to the idea that Austen’s works are not just artifacts of their time; they’re living, breathing texts that continue to spark dialogue. I mean, take Elizabeth Bennet again—her journey is one of self-discovery and defiance against societal pressures. I’m starting to see a pattern where her personal growth and the choices she makes reflect a broader quest for autonomy that resonates with today’s conversations about women’s rights.
  
  Now, I’m wondering how modern adaptations of Austen’s work might further this dialogue. For instance, films and retellings often reframe her characters’ struggles in contemporary contexts. It’s fascinating to think about how filmmakers and writers interpret her themes of independence and agency for today’s audience. This makes me think of how, in some adaptations, Elizabeth’s independence is amplified, making her even more of a modern feminist icon. 
  
  Oh! That reminds me of the diverse ways people engage with Austen today. There are numerous feminist readings of her work that highlight the nuances of her characters’ struggles. This connects to the idea that readers can extract different meanings from her texts, depending on their own contexts and experiences. It’s almost like a dialogue across time—what keeps nagging at me is how readers today might find empowerment in Elizabeth's defiance or Emma’s eventual recognition of her own flaws. 
  
  Let me untangle this a bit: if we consider the societal limitations Austen critiqued, it’s clear those same themes echo in today’s discussions about gender equality. I feel like we’ve moved from a focus solely on marital prospects to a broader conversation about women’s autonomy in all facets of life—career, relationships, personal identity. It’s like Austen’s narratives serve as a foundation for examining these evolving ideals of independence.
  
  I can see how her portrayals of marriage, particularly the various dynamics at play, challenge readers to rethink what partnership means. Rather than just a social contract, marriage in Austen’s world often serves as a reflection of personal choice and the struggle for mutual respect. This is starting to take shape, and it’s exciting to think about how her insights into relationships can inform modern discussions about partnership and equality.
  
  Backing up for a second, I need to consider how Austen’s own views on marriage might align with her advocacy for independence. It’s clear she had a keen observation of the institution, and her critiques often reveal the tension between love and social expectation. I’m getting a sense that she believed in love as a basis for marriage, but she also recognized the pitfalls of societal pressure. 
  
  What I’m grappling with now is how this tension translates into her characters’ journeys. Each character’s relationship dynamics can illuminate the ways in which independence can be both liberating and constraining. For instance, Emma’s evolution from a self-centered matchmaker to someone who learns about the importance of humility and self-awareness showcases a growth that feels relevant to today’s conversations about personal accountability in relationships.
  
  Now, I’m not entirely sure how this fits, but I wonder if there’s a connection between Austen’s critiques of marriage and the modern push for egalitarian partnerships. It feels like her insights can inform current discussions about what it means to be an equal in a relationship, where both parties respect each other’s autonomy while also building a life together. 
  
  I’m still feeling my way through how all these ideas intersect. The relationship between personal choice and societal expectations feels crucial, and I can see how Austen’s exploration of these themes continues to resonate with readers who are grappling with their own quests for independence. 
  
  Let’s also not overlook the cultural impact of her works. I feel there's something significant about how Austen has become a symbol of literary feminism. Her stories have been embraced by modern feminist movements, which often draw on her insights to advocate for women’s rights and autonomy. It’s almost like she’s become a figurehead for discussions about gender equality, and that’s an interesting evolution to consider.
  
  Ah, I’m still working this out, but it’s clear that Austen’s legacy is multifaceted. While she may not have incited a revolution in the traditional sense, her influence on literature and societal norms has arguably contributed to a broader understanding of independence and personal freedom. 
  
  What keeps nagging at me is how we can continue to engage with her work in meaningful ways. How can we use her insights to inspire discussions about autonomy and gender equality in today’s context? I feel like there’s a wealth of material to explore, and I’m eager to see how Austen’s themes can continue to challenge and inspire future generations. 
  
  So, let’s think about how we might facilitate further conversations around her work—perhaps through book clubs, academic discussions, or even creative adaptations that highlight her themes in a modern light. The intersection of past and present feels like a rich ground for exploration, and I’m excited to see where this dialogue could lead. There’s definitely more to unpack here, and I feel like we’re just getting started.

  **Austen's Context: Social Norms and Expectations**
  
  - **Historical Background**
    - The late 18th and early 19th centuries were marked by significant social and political changes in England, including the rise of the middle class and discussions about rights and individualism.
    - The Regency era saw the emergence of romanticism, which emphasized emotion and individual experience, contrasting with the rationalism of the previous Enlightenment period.
  
  - **Gender Roles and Expectations**
    - Women had limited rights and were largely confined to domestic spheres; societal norms dictated that a woman's primary role was to marry and raise children.
    - Marriage was often seen as a means of social and economic security, rather than a partnership based on love; women were expected to conform to the desires and expectations of their families and society.
    - The concept of "the ideal woman" was heavily tied to virtue, modesty, and submission, which shaped the behaviors and aspirations of young women.
  
  - **Marriage and Economic Security**
    - The marriage market was competitive; women were often pressured to marry well to secure their financial futures, leading to a transactional view of relationships.
    - Dowries and social status were critical factors in marriage negotiations, often overshadowing personal compatibility or affection.
    - The social stigma attached to unmarried women (often seen as failures or burdens) created a sense of urgency around finding suitable husbands.
  
  - **Literary and Cultural Influences**
    - The literature of Austen's time often reflected and reinforced societal norms, with many novels portraying idealized views of romance and domesticity.
    - The works of male authors frequently dominated the literary landscape, leaving female voices marginalized; Austen’s writing emerged as a counter-narrative.
    - The rise of women writers during this period, though limited, began to challenge traditional views and provide alternative perspectives on women's lives and choices.
  
  - **Austen's Personal Context**
    - Austen herself lived in a relatively stable family environment, which allowed her the freedom to observe societal norms with a critical eye.
    - As a woman writer, she navigated the challenges of being published in a male-dominated literary world, often using her pen to critique societal limitations while adhering to the conventions of her time.
    - Her experiences with her own family dynamics and social circles informed her understanding of women's roles, lending authenticity to her characters' struggles and aspirations.
  
  - **Subversion of Expectations in Austen's Work**
    - Austen’s novels often portray heroines who challenge or subvert societal expectations, reflecting her own beliefs about independence and self-determination.
    - Through characters like Elizabeth Bennet, Austen critiques the limitations placed on women and advocates for personal agency, showcasing the tension between societal norms and individual desires.
    - The portrayal of independent women in Austen’s work serves as a commentary on the absurdities of her time, urging readers to reconsider the roles and expectations imposed upon them.
  
  - **Impact on Contemporary Readers**
    - Austen's exploration of social norms and expectations continues to resonate with modern audiences, sparking discussions around gender roles, independence, and the evolving nature of relationships.
    - The tension between societal constraints and personal freedom in her work remains relevant, encouraging readers to engage with the themes of autonomy, choice, and empowerment in their own lives.
  **Refusal of Mr. Collins: A Radical Act**
  
  - **Context of Marriage Proposals in Austen's Era**
    - Marriage as a primary means of social security for women; economic dependence on male counterparts.
    - Societal expectation for women to accept marriage proposals, even from undesirable suitors, to ensure stability and respectability.
    - The pressure on women to conform to societal norms regarding marriage, including the idea that rejection of a proposal could lead to social ostracism.
  
  - **Mr. Collins as a Symbol of Societal Expectations**
    - Mr. Collins represents the absurdity of social conventions; his proposal is more about financial security and social duty than genuine affection.
    - His character is exaggerated to highlight the ridiculousness of societal norms surrounding marriage and the pressures placed on women to accept such proposals.
  
  - **Elizabeth’s Initial Reaction to Mr. Collins**
    - Elizabeth’s immediate instinct to reject Mr. Collins’s proposal showcases her independence of thought.
    - Her refusal is not simply a personal choice; it’s a deliberate stand against the societal expectation to marry for security rather than love.
    - The internal conflict she feels reflects the tension between societal pressure and personal desire for autonomy.
  
  - **The Significance of Elizabeth’s Rejection**
