*   The performance aspect of preservation, whether through taxidermy or filmmaking, raises questions about the nature of authenticity and the violence involved in creating artificial representations of reality.
*   The idea that preservation can be seen as a form of performance resonates with the notion that we are all engaged in our own acts of preservation, trying to freeze moments and memories that are inherently ephemeral.
*   The connection between preservation and the human desire to deny death, and how this denial ultimately makes death more present and permanent, is a profound insight into the nature of mortality and the human experience.
*   The way preservation can be a form of violence, not just against nature, but also against the passage of time, is a theme that underlies the entire narrative.
