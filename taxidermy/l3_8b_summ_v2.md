Answer 2:
It seems that preservation, broadly understood, might be considered the ultimate noir act due to several interconnected themes that emerged throughout your musings.

**Death and decay as a metaphor for the human condition**: The film, centered on taxidermy and embalming, has made you reflect on the human desire to defy mortality and the inevitability of decay. This reflects the noir theme of confronting and acknowledging the darkness at the heart of human nature. 

**Preservation as a form of performance**: Your internal monologue draws connections between taxidermy, acting, and filmmaking as forms of preservation and performance. These acts of preservation not only mask the essential truth of death and change but also create artificial recreations that can be just as captivating as the real thing. This blurs the lines between reality and artifice, much like the noir style does.

**The power of gaze and observation**: The act of watching, whether through a film, a taxidermied specimen, or even a preserved memory, can be seen as a form of preservation. This invited you to consider the ways in which our actions, both individual and collective, mirror the behaviors of the characters in the film. The audience, like the characters, is both participant and observer, influencing each other through our interactions.

**The violence of preservation and memory**: Your thoughts touched on how preservation, in its various forms (taxidermy, filmmaking, even memory itself), can be a form of violence against the natural order of things. This violence, comprised of the desire to freeze time and prevent change, can result in an accumulation of artifacts that reflect a distorted view of reality.

**Cycles of preservation**: The realization that preservation is not a one-time act, but rather an ongoing cycle that perpetuates a need to capture moments before they disappear, resonates with the noir theme of chasing shadows that always seem to slip away.

**Recognition and the human desire for consistency**: Your contemplations led to the understanding that preservation, whether through taxidermy, memory, or film, can also serve as a mirror for ourselves, highlighting our compulsive need for constancy and control in the face of change and decay.

**Preservation as a metaphor for life itself**: Ultimately, your reflections converge on the idea that preservation, through its multifaceted aspects of taxidermy, acting, filming, and the human attempt to grasp and ceased living moments into artificial representations, constitutes the symbolic embodiment of our existential predicament. Preservation represents an attempt to outrun the inescapable march of time, to stop death by freezing it into an aesthetic, static expression, and by doing so, enshrines the realization that it's everything that wishes to deny.

The culmination of these ideas culminates in a profound realization - preservation, through its allegiance with and characteristic of covering up, showcases the vigor of human endeavors in occupancy with mourning life.
